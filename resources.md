Resources for HAMS who need to be safe until the FCC changes their policy. 

1. There is currently a public repo for a contract to be used between two people in the US, where mail can be received at a house [here](https://github.com/rynyday/ryn-ham-wrld/tree/mail_contract_us). It should hopefully be done soon, and it would be very helpful for someone who has an understanding of contract law to look it over. While this project does exist, if there is someone you trust that is able to get mail for you, it is absolutely legal for you to do so and does not necessarily require the contract to do so (though it may make disputes messy without it).

2. commonlaw.name/fcc.html has citations from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Instructions for Volunteer Examiner Coordinators, and previous FCC guidance for the mechanisms in which one can have their actual name that has not been legally changed (or any name so long as it is not submitted with intent to deceive).

3. You can sign up for a post office box [here](https://www.usps.com/manage/po-boxes.htm), which the FCC does accept as a valid address. If you are concerned about safety, you do not have to obtain a post office box in the same municipality you live in. However, you will need to go to the post office to present your ID and obtain your keys. A small box will cost you somewhere between $6.00 and $10.00 a month USD, depending on how much you pay up front (and you usually have to pay at least three months in advanced).

4. There are many companies that offer this service as well, and those addresses are more widely accepted as permenant addresses. Use your favorite search engine to search for "virtual mailboxes". I cannot make any recommendations as I have no experience with them. I do also recommend reading the [Homeless Law Blog](https://homelesslaw.wordpress.com/category/mail/) to learn more about getting mail in a place where you don't live.
