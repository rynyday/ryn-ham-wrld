# Resources

Resources for HAMS who need to be safe until the FCC changes their policy. 

1. There is currently a public repo for a contract to be used between two people in the US, where mail can be received at a house [here](https://github.com/rynyday/ryn-ham-wrld/tree/mail_contract_us). It should hopefully be done soon, and it would be very helpful for someone who has an understanding of contract law to look it over.

2. commonlaw.name/fcc.html has citations from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Instructions for Volunteer Examiner Coordinators, and previous FCC guidance for the mechanisms in which one can have their actual name that has not been legally changed (or any name so long as it is not submitted with intent to deceive).
