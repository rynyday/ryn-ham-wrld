Rough outline of the arguments for both points of the petition.  Items in (parentheses) need research/citations.

# 1. Allow licensed amateur radio operators and applicants to easily opt-out of displaying their residential/postal address on the universal licensing system.

* Publication of a person's name and address can be harmful/dangerous
  * This has been repeatedly seen in cases of online doxxing (cite specific cases or overviews of the issue)
    * Not sure if it's helpful to our case, but former FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai's address was apparently posted online and there were some protests around his home when he suspended Net Neutrality (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Pai#Personal_life)
  * People may be targeted due to being members of a protected class (FCC must have some kind of nondiscrimination policy, right?) or they may need to protect themselves from malicious individuals, e.g. in cases of domestic violence
    * I was hoping the FCC might have something to say about doxxing since they regulate a lot of online communications, but the closest I've found so far is [this thing](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-looks-help-domestic-violence-survivors-access-connectivity) about allowing DV survivors to have separate phone lines from their abusers. We might be able to very carefully pull some quotes from one of the linked documents. 
* People will refuse to sign up for things that require revealing their personal information (citation?) for the reasons listed above.  
* Are there any moving anecdotes from people who have not become hams because of this or who have been targeted because their info was in a license database?
* This policy has already been implemented elsewhere (where?) without causing problems. (can we find/get statements from other ham regulatory agencies or national ham orgs about how this has worked for them?)

# 2. Allow licensed amateur radio operators and applicants to display a preferred name in lieu of their legally recorded given name.

* Allowing people to use their preferred name helps them feel welcome and increases the likelihood that they will join (citation?)
* Legal name change isn't readily accessible to everyone due to cost or bureaucractic difficulty. (citation?)

# Common points

* Since the goal of ham licensing is to make radio operation and experimentation accessible to anyone (cite FCC and/or ARRL and/or other voices commonly understood to speek for ham radio), we need to change the above things
* Something about how involving a more diverse population increases technical innovation (somebody must have studied this in other fields, right?) and technical innovation is one of the purposes ham radio is supposed to serve (that is in the FCC legalese, right?)
* Involving more people will also expand the pool of potential emergency radio operators (that's also in the FCC legalese, right?)
