# Petition

To Mr. Joel Taubenblatt,
<br><br><br>
We, being U.S. based amateur radio operators and other U.S. citizens concerned with this matter, bring before you this petition to express our grievance with FCC and their Universal Licensing System databases. We are aggrieved by the matter of our addresses and legal names being published online in the ULS and subsequently various databases on the internet. This is a concern for our privacy, safety, general welfare, and the future of amateur radio operation in the United States. While there exists good reason to protect this information, there exists no pertinent reason to publish such information publicly. We hope that our grievance is heard, understood, and that we are protected in our practice of this hobby we love so much.
