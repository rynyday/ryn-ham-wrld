# Mail Contract - US

This project branch is a space to develop a simple and as universal as possible (within the scope of the United States) contract where a person can hold a mailing address for another. 

## This contract will hopefully do the following:

1. Allow HAM's who are unable to purchase a PO Box or private mailing address to gain obscurity in their displayed address on the FCC database.

2. To be used in mailing address agreements in other facets.

3. To be legally sound enough to have basic and agreeable terms that protect both the person offering a mailing address and the person receiving mail at that address.
